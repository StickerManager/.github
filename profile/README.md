## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ This is Sticker Manager, An application to manage your stickers.
🌈 As only manage and copy/share stickers, only use [Sticker Manager](https://github.com/StickerManager/Release).
👩‍💻 If you need to mount your stickers to other APPs like QQ Wechat and so on, you can use [Sticker Sword](https://github.com/StickerManager/StickerSword), which is a xposed module app.
🍿 To download and share sticker packs, see [Sticker Share](https://github.com/StickerManager/StickerShare).


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
